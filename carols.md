<h2>Joy to the world</h2>
Joy to the world the lord is come

Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world the saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glorious of his righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders and wonders of his love

<h2>Deck the halls</h2>
Deck the halls with boughs of holly la la la …
'Tis the season to be jolly la la la …
Don we now our gay apparel la la la …
Troll the ancient yuletide carol la la la …

Fast way the old year passes la la la …
Hail the new, ye lads and lasses la la la …
Sing we joyous altogether la la la …
Heedless of the wind and weather la la la …

<h2>Mistletoe and wine</h2>
A child us king, the carol a sing
The old is past, there’s a new beginning
Dreams of santa, dreams of snow
Fingers numb and faces aglow

It’s christmas time, mistletoe and wine
children singing christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

A time for living, a time for believing
A time for trusting, not deceiving
Love and laughter and joy forever
Ours for the taking
Just follow the master

It’s a time for giving, a time for getting
A time for forgiving and for forgetting
Christmas is love, christmas is peace
A time for hating and fighting to cease

<h2>Mary's boy child</h2>
Long time ago in bethlehem
So the holy bible say
Mary's boy child jesus christ
Was born on christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A king was born today
And man shall live forever more
Because of christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music comes from afar
For a moment the world was aglow
All the bells rang out 
There were tears of joy and of laughter
People shouting let everyone know
There is hope for all to find peace

Now joseph and his wife mary
Came to bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear their child
Not a single room was in sight
And then they found a little nook
In the stable all forlorn
Then in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy child was born

Oh my lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my lord, there in the crib they found him
Oh my lord, a golden halo 'round him
Oh my lord, they gathered all around him
To see and adore

<h2>Drummer boy</h2>
Come they told me pa ra pa pam pam
A new born king to see pa ra pa pam pam
Our highest gifts we bring pa ra pa pam pam
To lay before a king pa ra pa pam pam
So to honour him pa ra pa pam pam
When we come

Baby jesus pa ra pa pam pam
I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pam pam
I have no gifts to bring pa ra pa pam pam
That's fit to give a king pa ra pa pam pam
I shall play for you pa ra pa pam pam
On my drum

Mary nodded pa ra pa pam pam
The ox and lamb kept time pa ra pa pam pam
I played my drum for him pa ra pa pam pam
I played my best for him pa ra pa pam pam
Then he smiled at me pa ra pa pam pam
Me and my drum

<h2>Rudolphi</h2>
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
You’ll go down in history

<h2>Jingle bells</h2>
Dashing through the snow
On a one horse open sleigh
Over fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride, 
On a one horse open sleigh

<h2>Away in a manger</h2>
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little lord jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky 
Looked down where he lay
The little lord jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
But little lord jesus, no crying he makes
I love thee lord jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh

Be near me lord jesus, i ask thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me i pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there

<h2>Hark the herald angels sing</h2>
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph in the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king

Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of a virgin’s womb
Veiled in flesh the godhead see
Hail th’ incarnate deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus our emmanuel
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king

Hail the heav’n born prince of peace
Hail the son of righteousness
Light and life to all he brings
Risen with healing in his wings
Mild he lays his glory by
Born that man no more to die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king

<h2>The first noel</h2>
The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country afar
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O’er bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where jesus lay

Then entered in those wise men three
Fall reverently upon their knee
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

<h2>When a child is born</h2>
A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights a way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whispers in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You’ve got to feel, you’re on solid ground
For a spell or two, no-one seems forlorn
This comes to pass, when a child is born

It’s all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

<h2>Oh come all ye faithful</h2>
Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye, oh come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him, born the king of angels

Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Christ the lord

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Oh sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to god in the highest

Yea, lord we greet the, born this happy morning
Jesus to thee be all glory given
Word of the father, now in flesh appearing

<h2>Silent night</h2>
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing allelujah
Christ the saviour is born
Christ the saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of god, loves pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus lord at thy birth
Jesus lord at thy birth

<h2>Felice navidad</h2>
