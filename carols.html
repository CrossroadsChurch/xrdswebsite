<h2>Mistletoe and wine</h2>
<p>A child us king, the carol a sing</p>
<p>The old is past, there’s a new beginning</p>
<p>Dreams of santa, dreams of snow</p>
<p>Fingers numb and faces aglow</p>

<br>
<p>It’s christmas time, mistletoe and wine</p>
<p>children singing christian rhyme</p>
<p>With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree</p>
<p>A time to rejoice in the good that we see</p>

<br>
<p>A time for living, a time for believing</p>
<p>A time for trusting, not deceiving</p>
<p>Love and laughter and joy forever</p>
<p>Ours for the taking</p>
<p>Just follow the master</p>

<br>
<p>It’s a time for giving, a time for getting</p>
<p>A time for forgiving and for forgetting</p>
<p>Christmas is love, christmas is peace</p>
<p>A time for hating and fighting to cease</p>

<h2>Mary's boy child</h2>
<p>Long time ago in bethlehem</p>
<p>So the holy bible say</p>
<p>Mary's boy child jesus christ</p>
<p>Was born on christmas day</p>

<br>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing</p>
<p>A king was born today</p>
<p>And man shall live forever more</p>
<p>Because of christmas day</p>

<br>
<p>While shepherds watched their flocks by night</p>
<p>They see a bright new shining star</p>
<p>They hear a choir sing a song</p>
<p>The music comes from afar</p>
<p>For a moment the world was aglow</p>
<p>All the bells rang out </p>
<p>There were tears of joy and of laughter</p>
<p>People shouting let everyone know</p>
<p>There is hope for all to find peace</p>

<br>
<p>Now joseph and his wife mary</p>
<p>Came to bethlehem that night</p>
<p>They found no place to bear their child</p>
<p>Not a single room was in sight</p>
<p>And then they found a little nook</p>
<p>In the stable all forlorn</p>
<p>Then in a manger cold and dark</p>
<p>Mary's little boy child was born</p>

<br>
<p>Oh my lord, you sent your son to save us</p>
<p>Oh my lord, your very self you gave us</p>
<p>Oh my lord, that sin may not enslave us</p>
<p>And love may reign once more</p>

<br>
<p>Oh my lord, there in the crib they found him</p>
<p>Oh my lord, a golden halo 'round him</p>
<p>Oh my lord, they gathered all around him</p>
<p>To see and adore</p>

<h2>Drummer boy</h2>
<p>Come they told me pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>A new born king to see pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>Our highest gifts we bring pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>To lay before a king pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>So to honour him pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>When we come</p>

<br>
<p>Baby jesus pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I have no gifts to bring pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>That's fit to give a king pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I shall play for you pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>On my drum</p>

<br>
<p>Mary nodded pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>The ox and lamb kept time pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I played my drum for him pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I played my best for him pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>Then he smiled at me pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>Me and my drum</p>

<h2>Rudolphi</h2>
<p>Rudolph the red nosed reindeer</p>
<p>Had a very shiny nose</p>
<p>And if you ever saw it</p>
<p>You would even say it glows</p>
<p>All of the other reindeer</p>
<p>Used to laugh and call him names</p>
<p>They never let poor rudolph</p>
<p>Join in any reindeer games</p>

<br>
<p>Then one foggy christmas eve</p>
<p>Santa came to say</p>
<p>Rudolph with your nose so bright</p>
<p>Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight</p>
<p>Then how the reindeer loved him</p>
<p>As they shouted out with glee</p>
<p>Rudolph the red nose reindeer</p>
<p>You’ll go down in history</p>

<h2>Jingle bells</h2>
<p>Dashing through the snow</p>
<p>On a one horse open sleigh</p>
<p>Over fields we go, laughing all the way</p>
<p>Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright</p>
<p>What fun it is to ride and sing</p>
<p>A sleighing song tonight</p>

<br>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way</p>
<p>Oh what fun it is to ride, </p>
<p>On a one horse open sleigh</p>

<h2>Away in a manger</h2>
<p>Away in a manger, no crib for a bed</p>
<p>The little lord jesus laid down his sweet head</p>
<p>The stars in the bright sky </p>
<p>Looked down where he lay</p>
<p>The little lord jesus asleep on the hay</p>

<br>
<p>The cattle are lowing the baby awakes</p>
<p>But little lord jesus, no crying he makes</p>
<p>I love thee lord jesus, look down from the sky</p>
<p>And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh</p>

<br>
<p>Be near me lord jesus, i ask thee to stay</p>
<p>Close by me forever and love me i pray</p>
<p>Bless all the dear children in thy tender care</p>
<p>And fit us for heaven to live with thee there</p>

<h2>Hark the herald angels sing</h2>
<p>Hark the herald angels sing</p>
<p>Glory to the newborn king</p>
<p>Peace on earth and mercy mild</p>
<p>God and sinners reconciled</p>

<p>Jesus our emmanuel</p>
<p>Hark the herald angels sing</p>
<p>Glory to the newborn king</p>

<br>
<p>Hail the heav’n born prince of peace</p>
<p>Hail the son of righteousness</p>

<p>Born to raise the sons of earth</p>
<p>Born to give them second birth</p>
<p>Hark the herald angels sing</p>
<p>Glory to the newborn king</p>

<h2>The first noel</h2>
<p>The first noel the angel did say</p>
<p>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay</p>
<p>In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep</p>
<p>On a cold winter’s night that was so deep</p>

<br>
<p>Noel, noel, noel, noel</p>
<p>Born is the king of israel</p>

<br>
<p>And by the light of that same star</p>
<p>Three wise men came from country afar</p>
<p>To seek for a king was their intent</p>
<p>And to follow the star wherever it went</p>

<br>
<p>This star drew nigh to the northwest</p>
<p>O’er bethlehem it took its rest</p>
<p>And there it did both stop and stay</p>
<p>Right over the place where jesus lay</p>

<br>
<p>Then entered in those wise men three</p>
<p>Fall reverently upon their knee</p>
<p>And offered there in his presence</p>
<p>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense</p>

<h2>When a child is born</h2>
<p>A ray of hope flickers in the sky</p>
<p>A tiny star lights a way up high</p>
<p>All across the land, dawns a brand new morn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>

<br>
<p>A silent wish sails the seven seas</p>
<p>The winds of change whispers in the trees</p>
<p>And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>

<br>
<p>A rosy hue settles all around</p>
<p>You’ve got to feel, you’re on solid ground</p>
<p>For a spell or two, no-one seems forlorn</p>
<p>This comes to pass, when a child is born</p>

<br>
<p>It’s all a dream, an illusion now</p>
<p>It must come true, sometime soon somehow</p>
<p>All across the land dawns a brand new morn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>

<h2>Oh come all ye faithful</h2>
<p>Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant</p>
<p>Oh come ye, oh come ye to bethlehem</p>
<p>Come and behold him, born the king of angels</p>

<br>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Christ the lord</p>

<br>
<p>Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation</p>
<p>Oh sing all ye citizens of heaven above</p>
<p>Glory to god in the highest</p>

<br>
<p>Yea, lord we greet the, born this happy morning</p>
<p>Jesus to thee be all glory given</p>
<p>Word of the father, now in flesh appearing</p>

<h2>Silent night</h2>
<p>Silent night, holy night</p>

<p>Holy infant so tender and mild</p>
<p>Sleep in heavenly peace</p>
<p>Sleep in heavenly peace</p>

<br>
<p>Silent night, holy night</p>

<p>Glories stream from heaven afar</p>
<p>Heavenly hosts sing allelujah</p>
<p>Christ the saviour is born</p>
<p>Christ the saviour is born</p>

<br>
<p>Silent night, holy night</p>
